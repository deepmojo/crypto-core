## Overview

[**DeepMojo Crypto-Core**](https://github.com/deepmojo/crypto-core) is a robust TypeScript cryptography library designed for Node.js and Electron environments. It provides a streamlined interface to cryptographic operations with secure defaults, built on top of the battle-tested [node:crypto](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/main/src/crypto) module.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @deepmojo/crypto-core

# or for yarn

yarn add @deepmojo/crypto-core
```

Pro Tip: In newer versions of yarn, to get a local `node_modules` folder you will want `yarn config set nodeLinker node-modules`.

## Build

`npm run build` or `yarn build`: Compiles the TypeScript code using the tsconfig.json configuration file. This script is used to build the project and prepare it for distribution.

`npm run build:typedoc:html`: Generates HTML site documentation in `./docs` as needed for generating the GitHub Pages documentation for this library.

`npm run build:typedoc:json`: Generates a `typedoc.json` in the root of the project, as needed for generating the static documentation for this library.

## Test

`npm run test` or `yarn test`: Runs the Jest test suite with verbose output and code coverage reporting. This script is used to test the project and ensure that it is working as expected.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the CryptoCore library to encrypt and decrypt a string:

```typescript
import CryptoCore, { CryptoCoreOptions, getUTF8StringFromBuffer } from "@deepmojo/crypto-core";

const options: CryptoCoreOptions = {
  OUTER_PEPPER: 'pepper is yum',
  INNER_KEY_ITERATIONS: 100,
};

const cryptoCore = new CryptoCore(options);
const salt = cryptoCore.getRandomSalt();

// Encrypt
const encryptResult = cryptoCore.getEncryptedStringSync('Hello, World!', 'secret password', salt);

// Decrypt
const decryptedString = cryptoCore.getDecryptedStringSync(
  getHexStringFromBuffer(encryptResult.result),
  password,
  salt,
  encryptResult.iv,
  encryptResult.authTag
);
```

For more examples and usage scenarios, please refer to the tests in the `src/tests` directory.

## Future Research

- Chromium SafeStorage API wrapper
- OTP/TOTP/Authenticator
- Pin/pattern hashing and verification
- JWE/JWK authentication
- Windows Credential Locker
- HSM, TPM, PAM, MFA, 2FA
- Hardware security: FIDO U2F, WebAuthn/FIDO2, TrustKey, Yubikey
- macOS Secure Enclave integration
